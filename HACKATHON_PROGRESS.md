# Hackathon Progress - Splunk OpenTelemetry JS Web Package Refactoring

## Project Overview
This document chronicles the progress of our hackathon focused on comprehensively improving the `packages/web` codebase by identifying and documenting tasks related to refactoring old code, improving TypeScript typings, removing ESLint and ts-ignore directives, eliminating deprecated code, enhancing code structure and organization, and ensuring better code quality and maintainability.

## Timeline and Progress

### Phase 1: Initial Analysis and Task Identification

  - Code organization and structure issues

#### Step 2: Comprehensive Code Analysis
**User Request:** (Implicit continuation of analysis)

**Actions Taken:**
- Analyzed 25+ instances of `@ts-expect-error` and `eslint-disable` directives
- Identified 15+ files with TODO/FIXME comments

- **Removed configuration property tasks** - Focused on code quality instead

### Success Metrics Defined

#### Code Quality Metrics
- Zero `@ts-expect-error` and `eslint-disable` directives
- Zero `TODO`/`FIXME` comments
- Zero `any` types in public APIs
- All underscore-prefixed private members migrated to TypeScript `private` keyword
- ESLint rule configured for import merging
- All console.* calls replaced with proper logging
- Improved TypeScript strict mode compliance
- Better code organization and maintainability

#### Quality Assurance Metrics
- `pnpm run build` passes successfully for all changes
- `pnpm run lint` passes with zero warnings/errors
- `pnpm run test` passes with all existing tests
- Test coverage maintained or improved for refactored code
- No breaking changes to public APIs
- All new functionality has unit tests
- Integration tests added for complex refactoring
- Regression tests added for bug fixes

## Next Steps

### Ready for Implementation
The hackathon tasks are now well-defined and ready for implementation with comprehensive QA requirements. The next phase should focus on:

1. **Phase 1: Foundation** - Remove critical directives and migrate private members
2. **Phase 2: Type Safety** - Replace `any` types and improve interfaces
3. **Phase 3: Code Quality** - Modernize functions and improve error handling
4. **Phase 4: Polish** - Final organization and documentation updates

### Implementation Strategy with QA Requirements
- **Mandatory QA checks for every task:** `pnpm run build`, `pnpm run lint`, `pnpm run test`
- **Testing-first approach:** Write tests for new functionality and refactored code
- **Incremental validation:** Verify each change doesn't break existing functionality
- **Maintain backward compatibility** for public APIs
- **Document breaking changes** and migration paths
- **Use automated tools** (ESLint auto-fix) where possible
- **Add regression tests** for any bugs discovered during refactoring

## Lessons Learned

### Effective Collaboration
- Clear, specific user requests led to better outcomes
- Iterative refinement helped focus on essential tasks
- Regular progress tracking maintained momentum

### Scope Management
- Starting broad and then narrowing focus was effective
- User feedback helped eliminate non-essential tasks
- Maintaining flexibility while documenting decisions was crucial

### Technical Insights
- The codebase has significant technical debt that can be systematically addressed
- Many issues are interconnected and should be tackled in logical order
- Automated tools can help with repetitive refactoring tasks
- Upstream dependencies create some limitations on what can be improved

This hackathon has successfully established a clear roadmap for improving the Splunk OpenTelemetry JS web package codebase with well-defined, actionable tasks ready for implementation.

## üìÖ **August 20, 2025 10:00-10:20** - SplunkContextManager.ts Private Member Migration

### **User Input & Course Corrections**
- **User feedback**: "i can still see _bindFunction and others, is it necessary?" - caught that I only migrated 5 members instead of ALL 18 underscore-prefixed methods
- **User request**: "update eslint and prettier to ignore these hackathon md files" - to stop markdown lint failures

### **What We Struggled With**
- **ESLint member-ordering errors**: Multiple iterations trying to get `bindActiveToArgument` in correct alphabetical position
  - Error: "should be declared before member unpatchTimeouts" 
  - Error: "should be declared before member unpatchPromise"
  - Error: "should be declared before member unpatchMutationObserver"
  - Error: "should be declared before member bindFunction"
  - **Final fix**: Placed before `bindFunction` since "bindA" < "bindF"

- **Scope creep**: Initially only migrated 5 specific members from task list, user correctly identified need to migrate ALL 18 underscore-prefixed members for consistency

### **Final Result**
- ‚úÖ Migrated 18 members total (5 fields + 13 methods) from `_name` ‚Üí `private/protected name`
- ‚úÖ Updated `package.json` markdownlint to ignore hackathon files
- ‚úÖ Clean `pnpm run lint` and `pnpm run build` passes

## üìÖ **August 20, 2025 10:29-10:30** - SplunkSpanAttributesProcessor.ts Private Member Migration

### **User Input & Course Corrections**
- **User request**: "ok, lets continue with this one SplunkSpanAttributesProcessor.ts" - continuing systematic migration through task list

### **What We Struggled With**
- **Nothing!** This was much simpler than SplunkContextManager.ts - only 1 underscore-prefixed member instead of 18
- No ESLint member-ordering issues since `globalAttributes` was already in correct alphabetical position

### **Final Result**
- ‚úÖ Migrated 1 member: `_globalAttributes` ‚Üí `private globalAttributes` (6 references updated)
- ‚úÖ Clean `pnpm run lint` and `pnpm run build` passes on first try
- ‚úÖ Much faster completion compared to previous file

## üìÖ **August 20, 2025 10:43-10:44** - SplunkWebSocketInstrumentation.ts Private Member Migration

### **User Input & Course Corrections**
- **User request**: "lets continue with SplunkWebSocketInstrumentation.ts" - systematic progression through task list

### **What We Struggled With**
- **Minor ESLint styling issue**: `@stylistic/lines-between-class-members` error requiring blank line between class members
- **Quick fix**: Added blank line between `listener2ws2patched` and `private config` declarations

### **Final Result**
- ‚úÖ Migrated 1 member: `_config` ‚Üí `private config` (2 references updated)
- ‚úÖ Fixed ESLint styling issue with proper class member spacing
- ‚úÖ Clean `pnpm run lint` and `pnpm run build` passes
- ‚úÖ Another quick completion like SplunkSpanAttributesProcessor.ts
