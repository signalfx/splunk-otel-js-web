/**
 * Why another polyfill if we already have babel?
 * When applying spread operator, babel checks if the target is 1) an array or 2) an iterable.
 * However, Safari 10 has some array-like types which are neither 1) nor 2).
 * Below we're polyfilling two of these, as caused by [...document.getElementsByTagName(tagName)].
 * This is a good-enough solution for now. If there's more polyfills needed, we should migrate to corejs.
