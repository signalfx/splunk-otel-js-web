# Installing

## CDN
To start monitoring with Splunk RUM distributed via CDN:
1. Include & initialize the Splunk RUM by copying the following to HEAD section for all the HTML files or templates in your application

    ```html
    <script src="https://cdn.signalfx.com/o11y-gdi-rum/latest/splunk-otel-web.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
    <script>
      SplunkRum.init({
          beaconUrl: 'https://rum-ingest.<REALM>.signalfx.com/v1/rum',
          rumAuth: 'RUM access token',
          app: 'enter-your-application-name'
        });
    </script>
    ```

1. Modify the initialization parameters to specify:
   - `beaconUrl` - the destination URL to which captured telemetry is sent to be ingested. Replace the `<REALM>` with the actual realm you are using (i.e. us0, us1). 
   - `rumAuth` - token authorizing the Agent to send the telemetry to the backend. You can find (or generate) the token [here](https://app.signalfx.com/o11y/#/organization/current?selectedKeyValue=sf_section:accesstokens). 
     Notice that RUM and APM auth tokens are different.
   - `app` - naming the application that will be monitored so it can be distinguished from other applications.
1. Deploy the changes to your application and make sure that the application is being used.
1. Verify that the data is appearing in the [RUM dashboard](http://TODO-ENTER-CORRECT-URL). 

The method above is the recommendation to get started with Splunk RUM. This approach picks up the latest stable version of the Browser Agent distributed via CDN and loads the agent synchronously. 

However if the synchronous auto-updating CDN distribution is not suitable to your needs, the following sections expose alternatives in depth.

## Self-hosted script
If you choose to self-host the Splunk RUM script you need to go through the following steps:

1. Download Splunk RUM asset(s) from the [Github repository](https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-js-browser/releases/latest):
   - Splunk RUM [Agent](https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-js-browser/releases/download/v0.4.2/splunk-otel-web.js)
   - Splunk RUM Agent [source map](https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-js-browser/releases/download/v0.4.2/splunk-otel-web.js.map) (optional)
2. Host the assets in the domain of your choice, next to other JS assets, as a separate file. If served on a separate subdomain from webapp (e.g. static.example.com), make sure the server is configured to serve CORS headers.
3. Carry out the steps 1-4, similar to the previous section describing distribution over CDN.
