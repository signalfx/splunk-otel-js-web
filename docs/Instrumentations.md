# Instrumentations

In this section, all instrumentations are described, along with their purpose and the description of the data model produced. 

## Instrumentation: Document Load

Document load instrumentation produces spans about resources that have loaded by the time [`Window:load`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/load_event) event fires. The root span generated is `documentLoad`. Following `documentFetch` and `resourceFetch` spans should have their `parentId` set as `documentLoad.id`. 

If the page load request has a `server-timing` header present it is used to link `documentFetch` span to backend span via link tags. Page loads in Safari browsers are not linked with the backend trace, as `server-timing` API is not currently supported on Safari. Resources loading during page load are captured via [`performance.getEntriesByType(‘resource’)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceResourceTiming) API. 

Splunk Browser Agent supports capturing different resources, such as: `script, link, css - font, iframe, XHR/fetch, img, favicon` and `manifest.json`.Notice that if any of these resources has a `server-timing` header set in the response headers, such resources will also be linked to the APM trace.

### documentLoad

Following tags are captured from the information captured by the `documentLoad` instrumentation:

|Name|Type|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|---|
|`document.referrer`|`string`|URI of the page that referred to this page via `a href`.|`"https://subdomain.example.com/"`|
|`screen.xy`|`string`|Width(x) and height(y) of the display.|`"2560x1440"`|

Following annotations are captured from the  navigation timings, as specified by the [W3C specification](https://w3c.github.io/navigation-timing/#sec-PerformanceNavigationTiming). The timestamps represent the NavigationTimings API events during a page load:

![Navigation Timing](https://www.w3.org/TR/navigation-timing/timing-overview.png)

|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|`fetchStart`|A timestamp immediately before the browser starts to fetch the resource.|
|`unloadEventStart`|A timestamp immediately before the user agent starts the unload event of the previous document.|
|`unloadEventEnd`|A timestamp immediately after the user agent finishes the unload event of the previous document.|
|`domInteractive`|A timestamp immediately before the user agent sets the current document readiness of the current document to interactive.|
|`domContentLoadedEventStart`|A timestamp representing the time value equal to the time immediately before the user agent fires the DOMContentLoaded event at the current document.|
|`domContentLoadedEventEnd`|A timestamp representing the time value equal to the time immediately after the current document's DOMContentLoaded event completes.|
|`domComplete`|A timestamp representing a time value equal to the time immediately before the browser sets the current document readiness of the current document to complete.|
|`loadEventStart`|A timestamp immediately before the load event of the current document is fired.|
|`loadEventEnd`|A timestamp when the load event of the current document is completed.|

### documentFetch

Following tags are captured by instrumenting the `documentFetch` invocations:

|Name|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`http.response_content_length`|`number`|The size of the document received from the payload body as specified [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceResourceTiming/encodedBodySize).|
|`link.traceId`|`string`|Trace identifier, captured from `server-timing` response header set by the APM agent|
|`link.spanId`|`string`|Span identifier, captured from `server-timing` response header set by the APM agent|

The annotations captured by the `documentFetch` instrumentation are described in the [HTTP request timing](DataModel.md#http-request-timings-annotations) chapter.

### resourceFetch

Following tags are captured by instrumenting the `resourceFetch` invocations:

|Name|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`http.response_content_length`|`number`|The size of the document received from the payload body as specified [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceResourceTiming/encodedBodySize).|
|`http.url`|`string`|URL of the requested resource.|
|`link.traceId`|`string`|Trace identifier, captured from `server-timing` response header set by the APM agent|
|`link.spanId`|`string`|Span identifier, captured from `server-timing` response header set by the APM agent|

The annotations captured by the `resourceFetch` instrumentation are described in the [HTTP request timing](DataModel.md#http-request-timings-annotations) chapter.

## Instrumentation: XHR/fetch

`XHF/Fetch`, as the name indicates, consists of two separate instrumentations. One is capturing [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) events and another for [XMLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest) events. The spans produced by the two instrumentations are almost identical. The only difference is set in the `component` tag value which differentiates between `xml-http-request` and `fetch`.

This instrumentation prepends the span `name` with HTTP + HTTP method name (eg. `GET`, `POST`). If the `XHF/Fetch` maps to a backend providing a `server-timing` header in the response, the link with the backend trace is also created by this instrumentation. 

All the tags captured by the instrumentation and exposed in next table follow OpenTelemetry [semantic conventions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/trace/semantic_conventions/http.md#common-attributes): 

|Name| Type and Description|
|---|---|
`http.method`|As specified in OpenTelemetry [semantic conventions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/trace/semantic_conventions/http.md#common-attributes)|

In addition, the `XHR/Fetch` instrumentation annotates the span with timestamps representing the time when the following XHR events fired:

|Name|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`open`|`number`|Time in UNIX epoch, measured in microseconds measured when [XHR open](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/abort_event) event fires|
|`send`|`number`|Time when [XHR send](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/send) event fires|
|`load`|`number`|Time when [XHR load](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/load_event) event fires|
|`error`|`number`|Time when [XHR error](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/error_event) event fires|
|`timeout`|`number`|Time when [XHR timeout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/timeout_event) event fires|
|`abort`|`number`|Time when [XHR abort](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/abort_event) event fires|

The annotations captured by the `XHR/Fetch` instrumentation are described in the [HTTP request timing](DataModel.md#http-request-timings-annotations) chapter.

## Instrumentation: Web Vitals

Web Vitals instrumentation collects data about Google [Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/) metrics. Web Vitals are captured as spans with zero duration. Every such span has a designated `traceId` and has no parent span.

Following tags are captured from the information captured by the `webVitals` instrumentation:

|Name|Web Vital|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`lcp`|[Largest Contentful Paint](https://web.dev/lcp/)|Measures loading performance by capturing the render time of the largest image or text block visible within the viewport.|
|`fid`|[First Input Delay](https://web.dev/fid/)|Measures interactivity by capturing the timestamp between user interaction (i.e. click on a link, tap on a button, etc) to the time when the browser is actually able to begin processing event handlers in response to that interaction.|
|`cls`|[Cumulative Layout Shift](https://web.dev/cls/)|Measures visual stability by capturing the sum of all individual layout shift scores for every unexpected layout shift that occurs during the entire lifespan of the page. A layout shift occurs any time a visible element changes its position from one rendered frame to the next.|

## Instrumentation: Post document load

This instrumentation collects data about resources loading after a page `load` event. By default, the instrumentation enables instrumenting for resource types `<script>`and `<img>` but adjusting the configuration allows it to harvest additional telemetry, given that the resource supports [PerformanceResourceTiming](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceResourceTiming) interface. 

Common use case where capturing information via this information is for example loading more images on `scroll` events.

The spans captured by this instrumentation would match the data model described in the [`resourceFetch`](#resourcefetch) section.

## Instrumentation: User Interactions

This instrumentation collects information on the user's activity with elements that have a registered event listener using `Element.addEventListener`. Events captured by this listener generate a span with the name matching the DOM event name.

|Name|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`event_type`|`string`|Event name (e.g. `click`).|
|`target_element`|`string`|Name of the target element (e.g. `BUTTON`).|
|`target_xpath`|`string`|XPath of the target element.|

Following is an example listener which would be instrumented with this instrumentation:

```html
<button id="add_row">Add a row</button>

document.getElementById('add_row').addEventListener('click', function (event) {
  fetch('/api/row', {method: 'PUT'});
});
```

### History API

User interaction instrumentation also instruments [History API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API) in order to provide visibility into the browser's session history. The history API is used to track URL changes that do not reload the page and is used in single page applications. Instrumentation also tracks URL changes done via changing the `location.hash` (by listening to `hashchange` event). Route change has no duration; it is just an event letting you know that the change happened. The info is sent as `routeChange` span with following tags:

|Name|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`component`|`string`|`"user-interaction"`|
|`prev.href`|`string`|Page URL before the route change.|
|`location.href`|`string`|Page URL after the route change.|

## Instrumentation: Long tasks

This instrumentation collects information about [long tasks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Long_Tasks_API). For every long task a span is created. 

Span attributes include containers that the task occurred within. For tasks that don't occur within the top level page, the `containerId`, `containerName` and `containerSrc` fields provide information about the source of the task.

|Name|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`longtask.name`|`string`|Usually `self`, see [specification](https://w3c.github.io/longtasks/#sec-PerformanceLongTaskTiming) for all possible values.|
|`longtask.entry_type`|`number`|Always set to `longtask`|
|`longtask.duration`|`number`|Duration of the task.|
|`attribution.name`|`string`|See [TaskAttributionTiming](https://w3c.github.io/longtasks/#sec-TaskAttributionTiming)|
|`attribution.entry_type`|`string`|See [TaskAttributionTiming](https://w3c.github.io/longtasks/#sec-TaskAttributionTiming)|
|`attribution.start_time`|`number`|See [TaskAttributionTiming](https://w3c.github.io/longtasks/#sec-TaskAttributionTiming)|
|`attribution.duration`|`number`|See [TaskAttributionTiming](https://w3c.github.io/longtasks/#sec-TaskAttributionTiming)|
|`attribution.container_type`|`string`|See [TaskAttributionTiming](https://w3c.github.io/longtasks/#sec-TaskAttributionTiming)|
|`attribution.container_src`|`string`|See [TaskAttributionTiming](https://w3c.github.io/longtasks/#sec-TaskAttributionTiming)|
|`attribution.container_id`|`string`|See [TaskAttributionTiming](https://w3c.github.io/longtasks/#sec-TaskAttributionTiming)|
|`attribution.container_name`|`string`|See [TaskAttributionTiming](https://w3c.github.io/longtasks/#sec-TaskAttributionTiming)|

The instrumentation doesn’t change the raw data captured from API’s, so for a more detailed description about the attributes see [PerformanceLongTaskTiming](https://w3c.github.io/longtasks/#sec-PerformanceLongTaskTiming) and [TaskAttributionTiming](https://w3c.github.io/longtasks/#sec-TaskAttributionTiming) interfaces.

## Instrumentation: Websockets

This instrumentation captures websocket lifecycle events and populates span with the information captured by the information. Websocket instrumentation is disabled by default.  The instrumentation is disabled, as without the understanding about the purpose and design of the communication protocol it would likely not be capturing useful information from the native websocket. This can be enabled in configuration. 

The instrumentation is capturing spans from websocket `connect`, `send` and `onmessage` events.

### connect

Captures information from `connect` event.

|Name|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`http.url`|`string`|Websocket URL.|
|`duration`|`number`|Time between websocket constructor call and ws.open event firing.|
|`protocols`|`string \| array`|Protocols passed to the websocket constructor.|
|`error`|`string`|`true` / `false` depending if an error occurred. Errors are captured during websocket construction(eg. Incorrect url) or when `ws.error` event fires.|
|`error.message`|`string`|Websocket error event message.|

### send and onmessage

Captures information from `send` and `onmessage` events.

|Name|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`http.url`|`string`|Websocket URL.|
|`response_content_length`|`number`|Payload size in bytes.|
