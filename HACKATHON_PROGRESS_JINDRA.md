# Hackathon Progress - Jindra's Work
## Splunk OpenTelemetry JS Web Package Refactoring


## ðŸ“… **August 20, 2025 10:00-10:20** - SplunkContextManager.ts Private Member Migration

### **User Input & Course Corrections**
- **User feedback**: "i can still see _bindFunction and others, is it necessary?" - caught that I only migrated 5 members instead of ALL 18 underscore-prefixed methods
- **User request**: "update eslint and prettier to ignore these hackathon md files" - to stop markdown lint failures

### **What We Struggled With**
- **ESLint member-ordering errors**: Multiple iterations trying to get `bindActiveToArgument` in correct alphabetical position
	- Error: "should be declared before member unpatchTimeouts"
	- Error: "should be declared before member unpatchPromise"
	- Error: "should be declared before member unpatchMutationObserver"
	- Error: "should be declared before member bindFunction"
	- **Final fix**: Placed before `bindFunction` since "bindA" < "bindF"

- **Scope creep**: Initially only migrated 5 specific members from task list, user correctly identified need to migrate ALL 18 underscore-prefixed members for consistency

### **Final Result**
- âœ… Migrated 18 members total (5 fields + 13 methods) from `_name` â†’ `private/protected name`
- âœ… Updated `package.json` markdownlint to ignore hackathon files
- âœ… Clean `pnpm run lint` and `pnpm run build` passes

## ðŸ“… **August 20, 2025 10:29-10:30** - SplunkSpanAttributesProcessor.ts Private Member Migration

### **User Input & Course Corrections**
- **User request**: "ok, lets continue with this one SplunkSpanAttributesProcessor.ts" - continuing systematic migration through task list

### **What We Struggled With**
- **Nothing!** This was much simpler than SplunkContextManager.ts - only 1 underscore-prefixed member instead of 18
- No ESLint member-ordering issues since `globalAttributes` was already in correct alphabetical position

### **Final Result**
- âœ… Migrated 1 member: `_globalAttributes` â†’ `private globalAttributes` (6 references updated)
- âœ… Clean `pnpm run lint` and `pnpm run build` passes on first try
- âœ… Much faster completion compared to previous file

## ðŸ“… **August 20, 2025 10:43-10:44** - SplunkWebSocketInstrumentation.ts Private Member Migration

### **User Input & Course Corrections**
- **User request**: "lets continue with SplunkWebSocketInstrumentation.ts" - systematic progression through task list

### **What We Struggled With**
- **Minor ESLint styling issue**: `@stylistic/lines-between-class-members` error requiring blank line between class members
- **Quick fix**: Added blank line between `listener2ws2patched` and `private config` declarations

### **Final Result**
- âœ… Migrated 1 member: `_config` â†’ `private config` (2 references updated)
- âœ… Fixed ESLint styling issue with proper class member spacing
- âœ… Clean `pnpm run lint` and `pnpm run build` passes
- âœ… Another quick completion like SplunkSpanAttributesProcessor.ts

## ðŸ“… **August 20, 2025 10:47-10:51** - SplunkPostDocLoadResourceInstrumentation.ts Private Member Migration

### **User Input & Course Corrections**
- **User request**: "continue with SplunkPostDocLoadResourceInstrumentation.ts" - systematic progression through task list
- **Complexity identified**: 4 methods vs previous simple 1-member files - more complex than recent files

### **What We Struggled With**
- **MultiEdit complexity**: Initial bulk edit failed due to exact string matching issues
- **Solution**: Methodical individual edits for each method declaration and call reference
- **7 total references**: 4 method declarations + 7 method calls throughout 175-line file

### **Final Result**
- âœ… Migrated 4 methods: `_createSpan` â†’ `createSpan`, `_processHeadMutationObserverRecords` â†’ `processHeadMutationObserverRecords`, `_startHeadMutationObserver` â†’ `startHeadMutationObserver`, `_startPerformanceObserver` â†’ `startPerformanceObserver`
- âœ… Updated all 7 method call references throughout the file
- âœ… Clean `pnpm run lint` and `pnpm run build` passes on first try
- âœ… No ESLint member-ordering issues - methods already in correct positions

## ðŸ“… **August 20, 2025 11:08-11:09** - SplunkConnectivityInstrumentation.ts Private Member Migration

### **User Input & Course Corrections**
- **User request**: "lets continue with SplunkConnectivityInstrumentation.ts, also note to use HACKATHON_PROGRESS_JINDRA.md, weve been running into merge conflicts with my colleague"
- **Adaptation**: Switched to individual progress tracking to avoid merge conflicts

### **What We Found**
- **Smallest file yet!** SplunkConnectivityInstrumentation.ts (67 lines) - even smaller than previous simple files
- **Already partially migrated**: `_createSpan` already had `private` keyword, just needed underscore removal
- **Super simple scope**: Only 1 method + 2 references to update

### **Final Result**
- âœ… Migrated 1 method: `_createSpan` â†’ `private createSpan` (removed underscore prefix)
- âœ… Updated 2 method call references (lines 50, 51)
- âœ… Clean `pnpm run lint` and `pnpm run build` passes on first try
- âœ… Fastest completion in our migration series - under 2 minutes total
